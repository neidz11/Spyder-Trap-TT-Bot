#Sparkle Turntable Bot

A customizable Turntable.fm bot.

This is still early in development, and some features are developed for/catered to the Indie/Classic Alt room, and may not apply to all rooms.

## Installation

To run the bot, you'll need the following installed:

## Run

Before running, make sure the config.js file is filled out with your bot account's userid, auth code, the target room id, as well as the admin id info (the admins array can be scaled up or down depending on the number of admins you want to have full control of the bot). Additionally, ensure that a mysql server instance is running on your machine.
